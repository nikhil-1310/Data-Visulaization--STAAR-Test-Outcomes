# Data-Visulaization--STAAR-Test-Outcomes
STAAR test data is the students performance in the exams in the state of Texas. There have been declines in the student performance from 2019 to 2021. This analysis provided a local non profit organization to identify the schools which are the bright spots and which are the focused areas.

Project consists of the district and campus level data along with the demographic data. Insights have been provided based on the visualizations. These trends identified using the visualizations can help students perform better in the future exams. 

The project was implemented using the following tools: Tableau, ALteryx, Excel, Powerpoint
